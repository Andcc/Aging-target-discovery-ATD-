# Aging Biomarker Identification using Gene Expression Data and Network Interactions

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at identifying novel gene expression biomarkers for aging using publicly available gene expression data and network interactions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can identify novel biomarkers for aging using gene expression data and network interactions. By incorporating network interactions, we aim to improve the model's ability to identify biologically meaningful biomarkers that play a role in aging-related pathways and processes.

## Data Sources

1. Gene Expression Data: Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
2. Protein-Protein Interaction Data: STRING or BioGRID

## Workflow

1. Data Collection:
   - Collect aging-related gene expression datasets from GEO and TCGA.
   - Collect protein-protein interaction data from STRING or BioGRID.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Normalize gene expression values across datasets.
   - Perform quality control to remove low-quality samples or genes.
   - Map gene symbols to standardized identifiers (e.g., Entrez Gene IDs).

3. Network Interactions:
   - Incorporate network interactions as additional features for each gene.
   - Calculate network-based features such as node degree, betweenness centrality, and clustering coefficient.

4. Feature Engineering and Selection:
   - Apply dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA or t-SNE to visualize and cluster samples.
   - Use feature selection methods such as LASSO or RandomForest to identify the most relevant genes and network features for aging.

5. Model Selection and Development:
   - Experiment with various classification algorithms (e.g., SVM, random forest, deep learning).
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

6. Model Evaluation:
   - Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and optimize model performance.
   - Evaluate the model on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

7. Interpretation and Validation:
   - Analyze the selected features (genes and network interactions) to identify novel biomarkers for aging.
   - Validate these findings using existing literature or experimental data.
